Example data and core matlab functions to run the GUI used for the paper titled "A muscle synergy based method to improve robot-assisted movements"

**1. Overview of the Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
This tool allows users to compare muscle synergies to a set of reference muscle synergies, facilitating the analysis of muscle coordination patterns. For users working with assistive robotic devices, this tool also supports the optimization of one assistance parameter (e.g. force) to enhance human-robot interaction. Specifically, users can apply a gradient descent optimization strategy to determine the optimal assistance level that improves performance.
